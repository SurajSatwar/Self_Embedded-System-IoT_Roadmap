# Level A — Foundations

- **A.1 Basic Electronics** — Ohm’s law, decoupling, pull-ups, LDO vs SMPS  
- **A.2 Digital Logic** — TTL vs CMOS levels, Schmitt triggers, level shifting  
- **A.3 C Basics (Embedded)** — types, functions, headers, arrays & pointers, debounce lab

## How I Work
1) Study notes → do lab → measure → write "Lessons Learned"  
2) Commit code + images + README  
3) (Optional) Post a single LinkedIn snapshot for the entire Level A

## Proof of Work Checklist
- [ ] A1: LED+button lab with real measurements
- [ ] A2: Truth-table screenshots + level-shifter sketch
- [ ] A3: Plain-C debounce running on MCU

> Repo root: add a short **/INDEX.md** linking each module.
