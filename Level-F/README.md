# Level F â€” Networking & Connectivity 

This level focuses on how embedded devices communicate with each other and the cloud.

##  Concepts Learned
- Network Architecture for IoT (device â†’ gateway â†’ cloud).
- Data Representation: JSON, binary formats.
- Messaging Protocols: MQTT, CoAP, HTTP.
- Getting on the Network: Wi-Fi, Ethernet, BLE, LoRa.
- Traffic Analysis with tools like Iperf & Wireshark.
- IoT Cloud Models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
- Device Identity & Security basics (encryption, authentication).
- Impact on software & hardware design.

##  Practical Activities
- Implement MQTT publisher/subscriber on ESP32.
- Analyze packet traffic using Wireshark/Iperf.
- Test JSON vs Binary payload efficiency.
- Setup secure device identity (unique keys).
