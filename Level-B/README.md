#  LEVEL B â€” MCU ARCHITECTURE & DATASHEETS

This level focuses on understanding **microcontroller architecture** and learning how to **read datasheets and reference manuals** â€” an essential skill for any embedded engineer.



##  Topics Covered

### B.1 MCU Fundamentals
- CPU core basics (8051, PIC18, ARM Cortex-M, STM32, ESP32).
- Harvard vs Von Neumann architectures.
- Flash, SRAM, EEPROM and memory mapping.
- Peripherals: GPIO, UART, IÂ²C, SPI, ADC, DAC, Timers.
- Clocks and reset systems.

### B.2 Datasheets & Reference Manuals
- Datasheet essentials:
  - Pinouts and alternate functions.
  - Supply voltage, current consumption.
  - Max operating ratings.
- Reference manual essentials:
  - Registers and functional descriptions.
  - Clock tree diagrams.
  - Peripheral configuration flow.
- Errata: identifying known bugs in silicon.



##  Purpose
- Learn how to extract key information from datasheets.
- Practice finding pin functions, memory sizes, voltage ranges.
- Build confidence in **register-level programming**.
- Essential for **industry readiness** and **job interviews**.



## ðŸ›  Practical Exercises
- **Choose MCU**: STM32F103C8 ("Blue Pill") or PIC18F4520.
