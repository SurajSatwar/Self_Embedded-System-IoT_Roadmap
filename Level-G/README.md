# Level G — Security & Reliability

## 📌 Overview
This level focuses on making embedded and IoT systems **secure and reliable**.  
Security is one of the most critical requirements for real-world IoT devices since they are widely exposed to cyberattacks.  
Reliability ensures that devices run safely and recover from errors in the field.

## 🎯 Topics Covered
- IoT Security Problems & Threats  
- Elements of IoT Security (Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, etc.)  
- IoT Security Challenges (heterogeneity, scalability, OTA, physical security)  
- IoT Security Tomography (layer-wise security)  
- Layer Attacker Model (device, network, application layers)  

## 🛠️ Practical Implementations
- Watchdog timer example (ESP32/STM32)  
- TLS-based secure MQTT connection (ESP32 to broker)  
- Secure OTA update with rollback
